# HubuFlex![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/CodeDreamer06/HubuFlex)
A simple movie manager made using C#, Tailwind and SASS.
## Motivation & Features
This project is a simple web app that helps you to keep track of your movies. It uses SASS and Tailwind for the styling. It has all the basic features you'd expect with such an application out of the box - like search, filters, sorting and pagination. The purpose of this project is to gain an understanding of ASP .NET MVC.
